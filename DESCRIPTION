Description: The tool will allow users to analyze mutation data from
    variant call format (VCF) or browser extensible data (BED) files.
    While a lot of tools already exist for the analysis of mutation data,
    functionality is often spread out across multiple packages and
    ensuring compatibility between different packages, with their
    different preconditions and postconditions, can often be cumbersome.
    Therefore, I plan to write this tool to streamline mutation analysis.
    Specifically, the tool will focus on mutations in exonic regions, and
    will have functionality such as being able to map the genomic location
    of the mutation to its location on the coding sequence (CDS) of the
    transcript with introns removed.
