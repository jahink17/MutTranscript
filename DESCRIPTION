Description: The tool will allow users to analyze mutation data from
    variant call format (VCF) files. The purpose of this tool is to streamline 
    the analysis of transcription-related effects of mutations, such as analyzing 
    whether the mutations are synonymous or nonsynonymous at the amino acid level, 
    whether they have any deleterious effects and so on. The tool also enables 
    the visualization of mutations in exonic regions, allowing the exploration 
    of how these transcription-related effects vary along the length of a gene. 
    It has the functionality to map the genomic location of mutations to 
    their location on the coding sequence (CDS) of the transcript, with the introns 
    removed.
